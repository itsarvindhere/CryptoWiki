# INTRODUCING CRYPTOWIKI - THE WIKIPEDIA OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES

Here is the Live Web App - https://cryptowiki.netlify.app/

This project was created using React, Ant Design, and Redux Toolkit. The data was fetched using the CoinRanking API and the Bing News API. 

Credits to Javascript Mastery for this amazing project -> https://youtu.be/9DDX3US3kss?list=PL6QREj8te1P6wX9m5KnicnDVEucbOPsqR

From my end, I worked on improving the overall look and feel of the web app.
